This folder contains the Amelia specifications for the automated deployment process of the Matrices Case Study. The Matrix-Chain Multiplication (MCM) problem is an optimization problem that consists in finding the most efficient multiplication sequence to multiply a set of given matrices. Our implementation to solve the MCM splits the problem into three different subproblems: the matrix-pair multiplication problem, the matrix-chain parenthesization problem, which finds the optimal sequence of matrix-pair multiplications minimizing the total number of additions and multiplications, and the matrix-subchain multiplication scheduling problem, which finds subsets of matrix multiplications that can be performed concurrently to decrease the overall multiplication time. 

In this implementation of the MCM solution, we take advantage of distributed computational resources in order to reduce the execution time when multiplying a large number of considerably big matrices. To this end, we developed multiple multiplication strategies (Strassen strategy, BlockReduceStrategy, N-Matrices Strategy, and Hybrid Configuration Strategy), based on the map-reduce paradigm, and variations of it that significantly reduces network usage. At the end, local multiplications are performed using the Strassen algorithm.
