\noindent
\textbf{Functional Suitability} & \\
\Qitem{In the software deployment domain, all concepts and building-blocks to solve the addressed problem can be expressed in \amelia{}.} & \rating \\
\Qitem{\amelia{} is an appropriate and useful tool for deploying software.} & \rating \\

\textbf{Usability} & \\
\Qitem{The language elements are understandable (\textit{e.g.}, language elements can be understood after reading their descriptions).} & \rating\\
\Qitem{The concepts and symbols of the language resemble the terminology of the deployment domain, are learnable and rememberable (\ie{}, learning easiness, easiness for developing deployment specifications).} & \rating \\
\Qitem{\amelia{} helps users achieve their deployment tasks in acceptable development times.} & \rating \\
\Qitem{\amelia{} is appropriate for the deployment of the type of software you work on.} & \rating \\
\Qitem{\amelia{} has useful language elements to control the actual deployment operations (\textit{e.g.}, language elements can be selected and put into practice easily, actions are undoable, error messages that explain recovery methods are available for controlling the deployment operations).} & \rating \\
\Qitem{\amelia{} has a concise syntax that allows expressing deployment operations in short specification files.} & \rating \\

\textbf{Reliability} & \\
\Qitem{\amelia{} prevents making errors in deployment specifications. The language constructs helps the user to avoid mistakes.} & \rating \\
\Qitem{\amelia{} includes the right elements and correct relationships between them (it prevents unexpected interactions between its elements).} & \rating \\

\textbf{Maintainability} & \\
\Qitem{\amelia{} is composed of discrete components such that a change to one component has minimal impact on other components.} & \rating \\

\textbf{Productivity} & \\
\Qitem{The development time of writing software deployment specifications is improved.} & \rating \\
\Qitem{\amelia{} allows to compose and reuse language elements, which increase efficiency at writing deployment specifications. } & \rating \\
\Qitem{\amelia{} helps to improve the productivity of system deployment.} & \rating \\

\textbf{Expressiveness} & \\
\Qitem{A deployment strategy can be mapped into a \amelia{} specification easily.} & \rating \\
\Qitem{\amelia{} provides one and only one good way to express every concept of interest.} & \rating \\
\Qitem{Each \amelia{} construct is used to represent exactly one distinct concept in the application domain.} & \rating \\
\Qitem{The language constructs correspond to significant application domain concepts. \amelia{} does not include domain concepts that are not important.} & \rating \\
\Qitem{\amelia{} does not contain conflicting or ambiguous elements.} & \rating \\
\Qitem{\amelia{} is at the right abstraction level for writing deployment specifications, such that it is not more complex or more detailed than necessary.} & \rating \\

\textbf{Integrability} & \\
\Qitem{\amelia{} can be integrated with other languages used in the software development process, such as using already developed libraries. (\textit{e.g.}, language integrability with other languages).} & \rating \\
